  "description": "This app, is about building a compatibility-based \"FriendFinder\" application -- basically a dating app.It will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users in an array in db. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.It built with Express to handle routing. The survey has 10 questions of your choosing. Each answer should be on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.\r The server.js file should require the basic npm packages we've used in class: express and path.\r htmlRoutes.js file should include two routes:\r A GET Route to /survey which should display the survey page.\r A default, catch-all route that leads to home.html which displays the home page.\r Your apiRoutes.js file should contain two routes:\r A GET route with the url /api/friends. This will be used to display a JSON of all possible friends.\r A POST routes /api/friends. This will be used to handle incoming survey results. This route will also be used to handle the compatibility logic.\r Once you've found the current user's most compatible friend, display the result as a modal pop-up.\r The modal should display both the name and picture of the closest match.",
